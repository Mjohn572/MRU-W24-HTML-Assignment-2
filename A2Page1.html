                <p>
                    To put it in simple terms, AI is a branch of computer science that is dedicated to 
                    creating intelligent machines that work and react like humans.

                <h1 class="secondbox"> How Does AI Work? </h1> 
                <p class="secondbox">
                    AI's work through 'Machine Learning' which is essentially how
                    computers recognize patterns and make decisions without being
                    explicitly programmed. Through trail and error, as well as practice,
                    a machine is able to take in data of all kinds and create predictions 
                    for noticing differences between, lets say a car and a bike. Deep learning 
                    is another method AI's use to develop their intelligence. This method is
                    Machine Learning, just with a considerable boost in processing power and
                    speed, giving the output from an AI to have minimal error.

                    Personal AI uses documents and information to create an AI Powered Assistant, to assist the user 
                    in their business. The stand out feature they have is their platform allows for the answers the AI gives
                    to be based on past information taken from the user. This creates a more personal user experience for 
                    the person using the AI compared to someone who would use an alternative chat bot.
