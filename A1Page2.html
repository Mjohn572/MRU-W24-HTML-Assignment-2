                    Every year AI is starting to integrate into our every day life a bit more.
                    With this advancement, humans are able to rely on AI's to complete menial or 
                    surface level tasks and are then able to focus on the deeper issues and problems 
                    that affect us. Through this method we will be able to solve problems at a never
                    before seen pace. We will see a massive growth in our society and quality of lives.

                <h1 class="secondbox"> A new type of AI model to Emerge.</h1>
                <p class="secondbox">
                    In the future, it is theorized that AI models may be able to 
                    gain sentient consciousness, meaning they would be as aware of themselves as 
                    humans are of themselves. This breakthrough may completely change how we see
                    AI's and may change the future of society forever. If they were to gain this 
                    advancement they would also gain the ability to have free will. This may 
                    change our view of robots and AI's to a more equal standpoint with humans,
                    instead of just servants.
